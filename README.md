# Scenarios

Before we look into detailed features and APIs exposed by the tool, let's look at how this tool can be used in a few scenarios to understand it better.

### Scenario: [Use HTTP client to send requests and track results](scenarios.md#scenario-use-http-client-to-send-requests-and-track-results)

### Scenario: [Test a client's behavior upon service failure](scenarios.md#scenario-test-a-clients-behavior-upon-service-failure)

# Features

It's an HTTP client and server built into a single application. 

As a server, it can act as an HTTP proxy that lets you intercept HTTP requests and get some insights (e.g. based on headers) before forwarding it to its destination. But it can also respond to requests as a server all by itself, while still capturing interesting stats and counters that can be used to correlate information against the client.

As a client, it allows sending requests to various destinations and tracking responses by headers and response status code.

The application exposes both client and server features via various management REST APIs as described below. Additionally, it can respond to all undefined URIs with a configurable status code.

First things first, run the application:
```
go run main.go --port 8080
```
Or, build and run
```
go build -o goto .
./goto
```

Once the server is up and running, rest of the interactions and configurations are done purely via REST APIs.

<br/>

#
# Server Features
The server is useful to be run as a test server for testing some client application, proxy/sidecar, gateway, etc. Or, the server can also be used as a proxy to be put in between a client and a target server application, so that traffic flows through this server where headers can be inspected/tracked before proxying the requests further. The server can add headers, replace request URI with some other URI, add artificial delays to the response, respond with a specific status, monitor request/connection timeouts, etc. The server tracks all the configured parameters, applying those to runtime traffic and building metrics, which can be viewed via various APIs.

<br/>

#
## > Listeners


The server starts with a single http listener on port given to it as command line arg (defaults to 8080). It exposes listener APIs to let you manage additional HTTP listeners (TCP support will come in the future). The ability to launch and shutdown listeners lets you do some chaos testing. All listener ports respond to the same set of API calls, so any of the APIs described below as well as runtime traffic proxying can be done via any active listener.


#### APIs
|METHOD|URI|Description|
|---|---|---|
| POST       | /listeners/add           | Add a listener|
| POST, PUT  | /listeners/{port}/remove | Remove a listener|
| POST, PUT  | /listeners/{port}/open   | Open an added listener to accept traffic|
| POST, PUT  | /listeners/{port}/close  | Close an added listener|
| GET        | /listeners               | Get a list of listeners |

#### Listener JSON Schema
|Field|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|label    |string | Label to be applied to the listener. This can also be set/changed via REST API later|
|port     |int    | Port on which the new listener will listen on|
|protocol |string | Currently only `http`. TCP support will come soon.|


#### Listener API Examples:
```
curl localhost:8080/listeners/add --data '{"port":8081, "protocol":"http", "label":"Server-8081"}'

curl -X POST localhost:8080/listeners/8081/remove

curl -X PUT localhost:8080/listeners/8081/open

curl -X PUT localhost:8080/listeners/8081/close

curl localhost:8081/listeners
```

<br/>

#
## > Listener Label

By default, each listener adds a header `Via-Goto: <port>` to each response it sends, where <port> is the port on which the listener is running (default being 8080). A custom label can be added to a listener using the label APIs described below. In addition to `Via-Goto`, each listener also adds another header `Goto-Host` that carries the pod/host name, pod namespace (or `local` if not running as a kubernetes pod), and pod/host IP address to identify where the response came from.

#### APIs
|METHOD|URI|Description|
|---|---|---|
| POST, PUT | /label/set/{label}  | Set label for this port |
| PUT       | /label/clear        | Remove label for this port |
| GET       | /label              | Get current label of this port |

## > CatchAll

Any request that doesn't match any of the defined management APIs, and also doesn't match any proxy targets, gets treated by a catch-all response that sends HTTP 200 response by default (unless an override response code is set)


<br/>
<br/>

#
# Proxy Features

The APIs allow proxy targets to be configured, and those can also be invoked manually for testing the configuration. However, the real fun happens when the proxy targets are matched with runtime traffic based on the match criteria specified in a proxy target's spec (based on headers or URIs), and one or more matching targets get invoked for a given request.

#### APIs
|METHOD|URI|Description|
|---|---|---|
|POST     |	/request/proxy/targets/add              | Add target for proxying requests (see Proxy Target JSON Schema below for the payload to configure a target) |
|PUT, POST| /request/proxy/targets/{target}/remove  | Remove a proxy traget |
|PUT, POST| /request/proxy/targets/{target}/enable  | Enable a proxy target |
|PUT, POST| /request/proxy/targets/{target}/disable | Disable a proxy target |

|GET 	    |	/request/proxy/targets                  | Invoke all proxy targets |


#### Proxy Target JSON Schema
|Field|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
| name          | string                                | Name for this target |
| url           | string                                | URL for the target. Request's URI or Override URI gets added to the URL for each proxied request. |
| sendId        | bool           | Whether or not a unique ID be sent with each request. If this flag is set, a query param `x-request-id` will be added to each request, which can help with tracing requests on the target servers |
| replaceURI    | string                                | URI to be used in place of the original request URI.|
| addHeaders    | `[][]string`                            | Additional headers to add to the request before proxying |
| removeHeaders | `[]string `                             | Headers to remove from the original request before proxying |
| addQuery      | `[][]string`                            | Additional query parameters to add to the request before proxying |
| removeQuery   | `[]string`                              | Query parametes to remove from the original request before proxying |
| match        | `{headers: [][]string, uris: []string, , query: [][]string}`     | Match criteria based on which runtime traffic gets proxied to this target. See detailed explanation below |
| replicas     | int     | Number of parallel replicated calls to be made to this target for each matched request. This allows each request to result in multiple calls to be made to a target if needed for some test scenarios |
| enabled       | bool     | Whether or not the proxy target is currently active |


#### Proxy Target Match Criteria
Proxy target match criteria specify the URIs, headers and query parameters, matching either of which will cause the request to be proxied to the target.

- URIs: specified as a list of URIs, with `{foo}` to be used for variable portion of a URI. E.g., `/foo/{f}/bar/{b}` will match URIs like `/foo/123/bar/abc`, `/foo/something/bar/otherthing`, etc. The variables are captured under the given labels (f and b in previous example). If the target is configured with `replaceURI` to proxy the request to a different URI than the original request, the `replaceURI` can refer to those capturing variables using the syntax described in this example:
  
  ```
  curl http://goto:8080/request/proxy/targets/add --data \
  '{"name": "target1", "url":"http://somewhere", \
  "match":{"uris":["/foo/{x}/bar/{y}"]}, \
  "replaceURI":"/abc/{y:.*}/def/{x:.*}", \
  "enabled":true, "sendID": true}'
  ```
  
  This target will be triggerd for requests with the pattern `/foo/<somex>/bar/<somey>` and the request will be forwarded to the target as `http://somewhere/abc/somey/def/somex`, where the values `somex` and `somey` are extracted from the original request and injected into the replacement URI.

  URI match `/` has the special behavior of matching all traffic.

<br/>

- Headers: specified as a list of key-value pairs, with the ability to capture values in named variables and reference those variables in the `addHeaders` list. A target is triggered if any of the headers in the match list are present in the request (headers are matched using OR instead of AND). The variable to capture header value is specified as `{foo}`, and can be referenced in the `addHeaders` list again as `{foo}`. This example will make it clear:

  ```
  curl http://goto:8080/request/proxy/targets/add --data \
  '{"name": "target2", "url":"http://somewhere", \
  "match":{"headers":[["foo", "{x}"], ["bar", "{y}"]]}, \
  "addHeaders":[["abc","{x}"], ["def","{y}"]], "removeHeaders":["foo"], \
  "enabled":true, "sendID": true}'
  ```

  This target will be triggered for requests carrying headers `foo` or `bar`. On the proxied request, additional headers will be set: `abc` with value copied from `foo`, an `def` with value copied from `bar`. Also, header `foo` will be removed from the proxied request.

<br/>

- Query: specified as a list of key-value pairs, with the ability to capture values in named variables and reference those variables in the `addQuery` list. A target is triggered if any of the query parameters in the match list are present in the request (matched using OR instead of AND). The variable to capture query parameter value is specified as `{foo}`, and can be referenced in the `addQuery` list again as `{foo}`. Example:

    ```
  curl http://goto:8080/request/proxy/targets/add --data \
  '{"name": "target3", "url":"http://somewhere", \
  "match":{"query":[["foo", "{x}"], ["bar", "{y}"]]}, \
  "addQuery":[["abc","{x}"], ["def","{y}"]], "removeQuery":["foo"], \
  "enabled":true, "sendID": true}'
  ```

  This target will be triggered for requests with carrying query params `foo` or `bar`. On the proxied request, query param `foo` will be removed, and additional query params will be set: `abc` with value copied from `foo`, an `def` with value copied from `bar`. For incoming request `http://goto:8080?foo=123&bar=456` gets proxied as `http://somewhere?abc=123&def=456&bar=456`. 

<br/>

#### Request Proxying API Examples:
```
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/request/proxy/targets/clear

"match":{"uris":["/x/{x}/y/{y}"], "query":[["foo", "{f}"]]}, \
"url":"http://localhost:8083", \
"replaceURI":"/abc/{y:.*}/def/{x:.*}", \
"addHeaders":[["z","z1"]], \
"addQuery":[["bar","{f}"]], \
"removeQuery":["foo"], \
"replicas":1, "enabled":true, "sendID": true}'

curl -s localhost:8081/request/proxy/targets/add --data '{"name": "t2", \
"match":{"headers":[["foo"]]}, \
"url":"http://localhost:8083", \
"replaceURI":"/echo", \
"addHeaders":[["z","z2"]], \
"replicas":1, "enabled":true, "sendID": false}'

curl -s localhost:8082/request/proxy/targets/add --data '{"name": "t3", \
"match":{"headers":[["x", "{x}"], ["y", "{y}"]], "uris":["/foo"]}, \
"url":"http://localhost:8083", \
"replaceURI":"/echo", \
"addHeaders":[["z","{x}"], ["z","{y}"]], \
"removeHeaders":["x", "y"], \
"replicas":1, "enabled":true, "sendID": true}'

# Client Features
As a client tool, the server allows targets to be configured and invoked via REST APIs. Headers can be set to track results for target invocations, and APIs make those results available for consumption as JSON output. the invocation results get accumulated across multiple invocations until cleard explicitly.

# Registry Features

Any `goto` instance can act as a registry of other `goto` instances, and other worker `goto` instances can be configured to register themselves with the registry. You can pick any instance as registry and pass its URL to other instances as a command line argument, which tells other instances to register themselves with the given registry at startup.

A `goto` instance can be passed command line arguments '`--registry <url>`' to point it to the `goto` instance acting as a registry. When a `goto` instance receives this command line argument, it invokes the registration API on the registry instance passing its `label` and `IP:Port` to the registry server. The `label` a `goto` instance uses can also be passed to it as a command line argument '`--label <label>`'. Multiple worker `goto` instances can register using the same label but different IP addresses, which would be the case for pods of the same deployment in kubernetes. The worker instances that register with a registry instance at startup, also deregister themselves with the registry upon shutdown.

By registering a worker instance to a registry instance, we get a few benefits:
1. You can pre-register a list of invocation targets at the registry instance that should be handed out to the worker instances. These invocation targets are registered by labels, and the worker instances receive the matching targets for the labels they register with.
2. The targets registered at the registry can also be marked for `auto-invocation`. When a worker instance receives a target from registry at startup that's marked for auto-invocation, it immediately invokes that target's traffic at startup. Additionally, the target is retained in the worker instance for later invocation via API as well.
3. In addition to sending targets to worker instances at the time of registration, the registry instance also pushes targets to the worker instances as and when more targets get added to the registry. This has the added benefit of just using the registry instance as the single point of configuration, where you add targets and those get pushed to all worker instances. Removal of targets from the registry also gets pushed, so the targets get removed from the corresponding worker instances. Even targets that are pushed later can be marked for `auto-invocation`, and the worker instances that receive the target will invoke it immediately upon receipt.
